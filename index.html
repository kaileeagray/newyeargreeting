        <h4>Steve</h4>
        <p>
          I took this picture of Steve at one of many visits to Fryin' Pan.
          Steve stayed busy working at Sanford. He enjoyed tinkering with RC cars, golfing, playing basketball, gaming, and going to Costco. Steve also loves visiting family and friends in Sioux Falls.
          Steve received a medal from Cory for becoming a vegetarian.

            I took many selfies on Snapchat this year. This is one of them.
            I enjoyed hanging with Steve, seeing family and friends, rollerblading, biking, and sleeping.
            I also got a new job. I started working as a web developer on December 5 at FBS Data Systems in Fargo.

        We're excited to meet baby Meek in July 2017! We're so thankful. Maybe we'll share a real picture some day.

          We ended 2015 with a trip to Las Vegas for my mom, Sandy's, 50th birthday.
          Then, we enjoyed a late holiday celebration with Steve's family in Sioux Falls. We also celebrated many birthdays with the Meek, Thue families.
        </p>
        <p>
          I visited my sister Tristan's family in Nebraska. Tom, Sandy, and I watched Grayson, Gillian, and Sulley while Tristan and Cory were at the hospital delivering Mallory.
          We're psyched to meet Kitch baby #5, Ella in March.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are happy to report that 3 of our 4 plants survived this year.

          In May, I drove to Portland with my friend Liz.
          Steve picked me up in Minneapolis and they spent the weekend enjoying the city.

          We enjoyed a camping trip with Dave, Crystal, Elizabeth, and Katerine. We roasted marshmallows and hiked. Crystal and Dave provided lots of good grub. Steve and I bought new comfy cots that did not fit into our tent. Steve caught a fish but it swam away (or floated away?) in the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steve took time off from work for Thanksgiving. We were able to enjoy Thanksgiving in Holstein and Sioux Falls.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were also able to spend Christmas weekend in Sioux Falls. My parents visited from Iowa. Steve and I had fun hunting down gifts for our family members.
          I loved trying to wrap presents <a href="https://youtu.be/AR4ZWFvVseU" target="_blank">using this method</a> while Steve loved wrapping <a href="https://youtu.be/HxJwUvqAxpo" target="_blank">like this</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're looking forward to celebrating Steve's birthday! Also, my parents are visiting Fargo over New Year's weekend.
          They are not only bringing themselves but also bringing up a trailer with a bed and a lawnmower! We're looking forward to their visit! They will be the first Gray/Meek family members to sleep in our new (to us) house!
